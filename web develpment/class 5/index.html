        I DISCUSS IN THIS PAGE THAT WHAT IS CHEMISTRY?
    </h1>
    <p style="color:blueviolet">
        Sitting between biology and physics, the field of chemistry is sometimes called the central science. This branch of science deals not with the most basic elements of reality, such as fundamental particles, or the complex world of living organisms, but the in-between world of atoms, molecules and chemical processes.

        Chemistry is the study of matter, analysing its structure, properties and behaviour to see what happens when they change in chemical reactions. As such, it can be considered a branch of physical science, alongside astronomy, physics and earth sciences including geology.
        
        An important area of chemistry is the understanding of atoms and what determines how they react. It turns out reactivity is often largely mediated by the electrons that orbit atoms and the way these are exchanged and shared to create chemical bonds.
        
        Chemistry has now split into many branches. For instance, analytical chemists might measure the traces of compounds in ancient pottery to discern what people were eating thousands of years ago.
        
        
        Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes that take place in living organisms, for instance in farming, and on the effect the resulting produce will have on our body’s metabolism.
        
        Organic chemistry, the study of compounds which contain carbon, connects up molecules in new ways to build and analyse an array of materials, from drugs to plastics to flexible electronics. Inorganic chemistry is the study of materials based primarily on elements other than carbon. Inorganic compounds can be pigments, fertilisers, catalysts and more.
        
        Physical chemistry involves looking at chemistry through the lens of physics to study changes in pressure, temperatures and rates of conversion, for example, as substances react.
        
        
        Chemists help us understand the nature and properties of the world around us and the history of chemistry is replete with discoveries that have furthered this. Antoine Lavoisier paved the way for modern chemistry. He helped give the field structure by developing an ordered language and symbolism. And his understanding of the constituent parts of air, as well as the process of combustion, disproved centuries of incorrect thinking. But there is perhaps no more important chemist than  Dmitri Mendeleev, the Russian who in 1869 wrote down the symbols for all the known chemical elements, arranging them according to their atomic weight. He had created the periodic table, making it possible to predict how any given element would react with another, the compounds it would form and what kind of physical properties it would have.
        
        Chemists have subsequently given us treatments for cancer, advanced our understanding of radioactive elements and developed mobile X rays for use in field hospitals – and that’s just Marie Curie. Rosalind Franklin helped us understand that DNA was structured as a double helix, paving the way for the modern revolution in genetic science.
        
        More recently, advances in chemistry and biology have contributed to the development of vaccines to the coronavirus, using our knowledge of DNA and RNA to create the first approved messenger RNA vaccines (mRNA). From the development of plastics, and with it nylon, waterproof clothing and even bulletproof vests, to the liquid crystal display you are most likely reading this information on, right through to the complete synthesis of medicines, chemistry’s contributions to modern life are myriad.

<h2 style=color:brown> JABIR IBNE HAYAN</h2>     
<p style=color:brown>
    Jabir (known as Geber in western history) is mostly known for his contributions to chemistry. He emphasised systematic experimentation, and did much to free alchemy from superstition and turn it into a science. He is credited with the invention of many types of now-basic chemical laboratory equipment, and with the discovery and description of many now-commonplace chemical substances and processes – such as the hydrochloric and nitric acids, distillation, and crystallisation – that have become the foundation of today's chemistry and chemical engineering.

    In spite of his leanings toward mysticism (he was considered a Sufi) and superstition, he more clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation. "The first essential in chemistry", he declared, "is that you should perform practical work and conduct experiments, for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain the least degree of mastery."

    Jabir is also credited with the invention and development of several chemical instruments that are still used today, such as the alembic, which made distillation easy, safe, and efficient. By distilling various salts together with sulfuric acid, Jabir discovered hydrochloric acid (from salt) and nitric acid (from saltpeter). By combining the two, he invented aqua regia, one of the few substances that can dissolve gold. Besides its obvious applications to gold extraction and purification, this discovery would fuel the dreams and despair of alchemists for the next thousand years. He is also credited with the discovery of citric acid (the sour component of lemons and other unripe fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), and tartaric acid (from wine-making residues).

    Jabir applied his chemical knowledge to the improvement of many manufacturing processes, such as making steel and other metals, preventing rust, engraving gold, dyeing and waterproofing cloth, tanning leather, and the chemical analysis of pigments and other substances. He developed the use of manganese dioxide in glassmaking, to counteract the green tinge produced by iron — a process that is still used today. He noted that boiling wine released a flammable vapor, thus paving the way to Al-Razi's discovery of ethanol.

    The seeds of the modern classification of elements into metals and non-metals could be seen in his chemical nomenclature. He proposed three categories: "spirits" which vaporise on heating, like camphor, arsenic, and ammonium chloride; "metals", like gold, silver, lead, copper, and iron; and "stones" that can be converted into powders. In the Middle Ages, Jabir's treatises on alchemy were translated into Latin and became standard texts for European alchemists. Several technical terms introduced by Jabir, such as alkali, have found their way into various European languages and have become part of scientific vocabulary.

<h2 style=color:darkgreen> IBNE AL HAITHAM</h2> 
<P style=color:darkgreen>
    Ibn al-Haytham was born in the year 965 in Basra, and died in about 1040 in Cairo. He was one of the earliest scientists to study the characteristics of light and the mechanism/process of vision. He sought experimental proof of his theories and ideas.
